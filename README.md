### Technologies Used
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript (ES6+)
 - React.js
 - Bootstrap (for consistent styling)
 - Framer Motion (for animations)

### Challenges Faced
 - *Responsive Design:* Ensuring that all elements resize and reflow correctly across different screen sizes was a challenge, particularly with complex layouts.
 - *Cross-Browser Compatibility:* Testing and fixing issues across different browsers required significant effort.
 - *Performance Optimization:* Balancing visual fidelity with performance, especially on slower network connections, was a challenge.
